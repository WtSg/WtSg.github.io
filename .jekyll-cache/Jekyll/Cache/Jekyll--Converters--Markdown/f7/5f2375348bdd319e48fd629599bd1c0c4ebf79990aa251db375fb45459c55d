I"d<p>I am a research assistant in ECE at Washington University in St. Louis with  <a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Matthew-Lew.html">Professor Matthew Lew</a>.  Before that, I was a master student in the  <a href="https://cigroup.wustl.edu/">Computational Imaging Group</a> with Prof. Ulugbek Kamilov. In 2019, I worked as a visiting research assistant at  <a href="https://www.siat-sz.edu.cn/institut/center-for-optoelectronic-technology/">Center for Optoelectronic Technology, SIAT</a>.  SIAT is a cool place where engineers and researchers made many brillient products.  I received BS from Nanchang University in 2019. 
My current research interests include computational imaging, inverse problems, compressed sensing, Implicit neural representations, neural video representations, video processing, video interpolation, computer vision, and so on.</p>
