I"V<p>We designed an in-situ chemical oxygen demand (COD) sensor for long-term seawater  monitoring, and interrated it to a buoy for coastal trials. It makes COD monitoring  becomes possible and simple. The sensors had been contiously working underwater for  more than 6 months and provides thousands of valuable UV-Vis absorption spectrum.</p>
