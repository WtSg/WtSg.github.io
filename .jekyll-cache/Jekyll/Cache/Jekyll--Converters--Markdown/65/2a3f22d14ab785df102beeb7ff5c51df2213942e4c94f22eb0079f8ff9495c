I"C<p>In this small project, I designed and made a wireless electromagnetic gun.  Both radio and gun are built with STM32F103. The radio could show the current voltage,  firing status, and could auto detect object near it. When the object approaching,  it will send fire signal to the electromagnetic gun through 2.4G NFR24L01. The controller  has two buttons that user could use for manually firing. The electromagnetic gun is  powered by two XL6009 that transfer 12V DC to ~70V DC. Two capacitances are used  to store the power. The steel ball could be ejected for ~ 30feets.</p>
