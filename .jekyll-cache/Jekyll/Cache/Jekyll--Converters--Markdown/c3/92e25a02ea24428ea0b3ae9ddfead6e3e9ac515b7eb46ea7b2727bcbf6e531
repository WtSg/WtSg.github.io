I"ƒ<p>I am a research assistant in ECE at Washington University in St. Louis with  <a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Matthew-Lew.html">Professor Matthew Lew</a>.  Before that, I was a master student in the  <a href="https://cigroup.wustl.edu/">Computational Imaging Group</a> with Prof. Ulugbek Kamilov. I worked on computer vision and deep learning algorithms. Specifically, I proposed  the first neural field (NF) based video frame interpolation algorithm.</p>
