I"Ë<p>My Agent as Myself studies what happens when users interact with embodied conversational agents that look like them.  Would users follow the agentsâ€™ advice? Users in the study created faces for agents, one that resembled them and one that is suitable for providing feedback.  We found when someone else created the faces, users listened more to faces that resembled them.  However, when users created the faces, they listened less to their own face.</p>
