I"}<p>Single photon imaging system is a photon counting based singel pixel camera, which  takes picture with compressed sensing (CS) theory. We proposed an smart adaptive  measurement matrix to improve the performance of CS reconstruction ability. The  experiement shows our smart matrix could work for many algorithms and could be used for modify any kind of measurement matrix.</p>
