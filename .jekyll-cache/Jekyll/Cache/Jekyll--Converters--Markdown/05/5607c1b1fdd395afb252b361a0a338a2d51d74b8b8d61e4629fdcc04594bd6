I"¡<p>I am a research assistant in ECE at Washington University in St. Louis with  <a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Matthew-Lew.html">Professor Matthew Lew</a>.  Before that, I was a master student in the  <a href="https://cigroup.wustl.edu/">Computational Imaging Group</a> with Prof. Ulugbek Kamilov. I worked on computer vision and deep learning algorithms. Specifically, I proposed  the first neural field (NF) based video frame interpolation algorithm.
<br /><br /> In 2019, I worked as a visiting research assistant at  <a href="http://coet.siat.ac.cn/mobile/web/page/show/136.shtml?type=100&amp;category_id=0">Center for Optoelectronic Technology, SIAT</a>.  SIAT is a cool place where engineers and researchers made many brilliant products.  I focus on the design and building of in-situ chemical oxygen demand (COD) sensor  for long-term seawater monitoring. This is where arouse my interest of optical instruments. 
<br /><br /> My current research interests include computational imaging, inverse problems,  compressed sensing, Implicit neural representations, neural video representations,  video processing, video interpolation, computer vision, and so on.</p>
