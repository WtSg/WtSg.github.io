I"Œ<p>I am a research assistant in ECE at Washington University in St. Louis with  <a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Matthew-Lew.html">Professor Matthew Lew</a>.  Before that, I was a master student in the  <a href="https://cigroup.wustl.edu/">Computational Imaging Group</a> with Prof. Ulugbek Kamilov. I worked on computer vision and deep learning algorithms. Specifically, I proposed  the first neural field (NF) based video frame interpolation algorithm. <br /><br /> In 2019, I worked as a visiting research assistant at  <a href="http://coet.siat.ac.cn/mobile/web/page/show/136.shtml?type=100&amp;category_id=0">Center for Optoelectronic Technology, SIAT</a>.  SIAT is a cool place where engineers and researchers made many brilliant products.  I focus on the design and building of in-situ chemical oxygen demand (COD) sensor  for long-term seawater monitoring. SIAT is where arouse my interest of optical systems.  Prior to that, I did my BS in NCU with Prof. Qiurong Yan. We built a single photon  compressed imaging system with digital micromirror device (DMD) and photomultiplier tube (PMT). It is a cool system that let me know how diverse the optical imaging system could be.  <br /><br /> I love imaging and computer vision (CV). I believe it is important for   collaboratively develop imaging systems and CV algorithms. This is where a lot of high quality innovations were crteated.  My current research interests include computational imaging, inverse problems,  Machine learning, Implicit neural representations, neural video representations,  video processing, video interpolation, computer vision, and so on. <br /><br /> Besides that, I love</p>
