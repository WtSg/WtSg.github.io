  name: 'Personal Informatics &amp; Context: Using Context to Reveal Factors that Affect Behavior'
  description: >
    My Ph.D. thesis explores the use of contextual information in personal informatics systems to help users understand the factors that affect their behavior. 
    Most personal informatics systems only show one type of behavioral information, which makes it difficult to discover the factors that affect one's behavior. 
    Supporting exploration of multiple types of contextual and behavioral information in a single interface may help.
