  name: 'Adaptive Single Photon Compressed Imaging Based on Constructing a Smart Threshold Matrix'
  description: >
    Single photon imaging system is a photon counting based singel pixel camera, which 
    takes picture with compressed sensing (CS) theory. We proposed an smart adaptive 
    measurement matrix to improve the performance of CS reconstruction ability. The 
    experiement shows our smart matrix could work for many algorithms and could be used
    for modify any kind of measurement matrix.

  name: 'Underwater spectrophotometer for in-situ seawater COD monitoring'
  description: >
    We designed an in-situ chemical oxygen demand (COD) sensor for long-term seawater 
    monitoring, and interrated it to a buoy for coastal trials. It makes COD monitoring 
    becomes possible and simple. The sensors had been contiously working underwater for 
    more than 6 months and provides thousands of valuable UV-Vis absorption spectrum.

  name: 'Learning Cross-Video Neural Representations for High-Quality Frame Interpolation'
  description: >
   Cross-Video Neural Representation (CURE) is a Deep-learning-based model for temporal 
   video interpolation, where the goal is to synthesize a new video frame given its two 
   neighbors. It is the first video interpolation method based on neural fields (NF) 
   and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on video 
   interpolation on several benchmark datasets.

  name: 'Wireless Auto-Detection Electromagnetic Gun'
  description: >
   In this small project, I designed and made a wireless electromagnetic gun. 
   Both radio and gun are built with STM32F103. The radio could show the current voltage, 
   firing status, and could auto detect object near it. When the object approaching, 
   it will send fire signal to the electromagnetic gun through 2.4G NFR24L01. The controller 
   has two buttons that user could use for manually firing. The electromagnetic gun is 
   powered by two XL6009 that transfer 12V DC to ~70V DC. Two capacitances are used 
   to store the power. The steel ball could be ejected for ~30 feets.

  name: 'Three Phase DC-AC Converter'
  description: >
   This three phase DC-AC converter aims for converting 12V DC power to 
   three phase 24V AC power. This system is controlled by a STM32F103 Microcontrol Unit, 
   which provides features like voltage regulation, phase regulation, over-current protection.
   The efficiency is higher than 90%. Phase regulation enables two converter grid-connected. 
   The output voltage is regulated with PID algorithm for 100 times per second.
