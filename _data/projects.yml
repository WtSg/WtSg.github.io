  name: 'Learning Cross-Video Neural Representations for High-Quality Frame Interpolation'
  description: >
   Cross-Video Neural Representation (CURE) is a Deep-learning-based model for temporal 
   video interpolation, where the goal is to synthesize a new video frame given its two 
   neighbors. It is the first video interpolation method based on neural fields (NF) 
   and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on video 
   interpolation on several benchmark datasets.

  name: 'Underwater spectrophotometer for in-situ seawater COD monitoring'
  description: >
    We designed an in-situ chemical oxygen demand (COD) sensor for long-term seawater 
    monitoring, and interrated it to a buoy for coastal trials. It makes COD monitoring 
    becomes possible and simple. The sensors had been contiously working underwater for 
    more than 6 months and provides thousands of valuable UV-Vis absorption spectrum.

  name: 'Adaptive Single Photon Compressed Imaging Based on Constructing a Smart Threshold Matrix'
  description: >
    Single photon imaging system is a photon counting based singel pixel camera, which 
    takes picture with compressed sensing (CS) theory. We proposed an smart adaptive 
    measurement matrix to improve the performance of CS reconstruction ability. The 
    experiement shows our smart matrix could work for many algorithms and could be used
    for modify any kind of measurement matrix.
