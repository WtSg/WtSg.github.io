  name: 'Learning Cross-Video Neural Representations for High-Quality Frame Interpolation'
  description: >
   Cross-Video Neural Representation (CURE) is a Deep-learning-based model for temporal 
   video interpolation, where the goal is to synthesize a new video frame given its two 
   neighbors. It is the first video interpolation method based on neural fields (NF) 
   and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on video 
   interpolation on several benchmark datasets.
