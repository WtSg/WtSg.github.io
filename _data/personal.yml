intro:
  title: About me
  body: >
    I am a current Ph.D. candidate in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department 
    at Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/eng/departments/ece/phd/), advised by 
    [Prof. Vivek Goyal](https://www.vivekgoyal.org/default.htm). My research focuses on 
    developing computational algorithms for imaging systems, particularly on a large-scale 
    model designed to efficiently handle a substantial number of input frames.
    <br><br>
    Previously, I completed my MS at Washington University in St. Louis, where I was part 
    of the [Computational Imaging Group](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/) under Prof. Ulugbek 
    Kamilov, focusing on computer vision and deep learning algorithms. My experience also 
    includes a stint as a visiting research assistant at the [The Center for Optoelectronics 
    Technology, SIAT](https://coet.siat.ac.cn/frontend/web/#)
    , where I further honed my skills in optical system design.
