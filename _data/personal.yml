intro:
  title: About me
  body: >
    I am a research assistant in ECE at Washington University in St. Louis with 
    [Professor Matthew Lew](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Matthew-Lew.html). 
    Before that, I was a master student in the 
    [Computational Imaging Group](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/) with Prof. Ulugbek Kamilov.
    In 2019, I worked as a visiting research assistant at 
    [Center for Optoelectronic Technology, SIAT](http://coet.siat.ac.cn/mobile/web/page/show/136.shtml?type=100&category_id=0). 
    SIAT is a cool place where engineers and researchers made many brilliant products. 

    <br><br>
    My current research interests include computational imaging, inverse problems, 
    compressed sensing, Implicit neural representations, neural video representations, 
    video processing, video interpolation, computer vision, and so on.
